            <p>This education aims to educate students with an industry driven mindset. It therefore teaches students about the entire software development process from covering 
                company needs to software construction, software design, database design, IT security, project management and deployment 
                of said software using various CI/CD technologies.</p>
            <p>During my education I have participated in various software development related activities such as:<br>
            • Collaborating with students on front-end, back-end and full-stack projects <br>
            • Applying agile software development techniques such as SCRUM in a hands-on fashion (e.g. SCRUM Master) <br>
            • Developing and designing software during projects with small and medium-sized companies <br>
            • Working with software development and database design using various programming languages and frameworks such as Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, MySQL, Python, Angular, Node.js, MongoDB and Firebase. <br>

            <p>Before starting my education in computer science I attended a bachelors programme at the Danish Technical University for 3 semesters to become a biomedical engineer. <br>
                During these semesters I gained knowledge in mathematical modelling, programming simulations, statistics as well as biology, biochemistry, anatomy and pathophysiology. 
                Gaining knowledge in these fields and modelling them programatically was something that sparked a great interest in me, and was the my main motivation to start pursuing my degree in Computer Science.
